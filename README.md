## Advent of Code: A Festive Coding Adventure
Advent of Code is a 25-day coding extravaganza, where programmers from around the world tackle daily puzzles in the spirit of holiday cheer.
Each challenge is a mix of brain-twisting logic, algorithmic delight, and occasionally, a healthy dose of debugging despair. It's the perfect way to combine your love for coding with the countdown to Christmas!

## About This Repository
This repository is where I store my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles.
While the event is designed as a daily challenge in December, I'll be tackling these puzzles at my own pace :)
